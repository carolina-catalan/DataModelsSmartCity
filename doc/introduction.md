# Smart city harmonized Data Models

These data models describe the main entities involved with smart applications that deal with smart city issues.
The objective is to present three data models that will could be applied in application for monitoring traffic and pollution. The mdata models are: user profile, disease profile and vehicle profile.

* User profile data model: This model is intended to represent the characteristics of the smart city user (disabilities, diseases, age, sex, etc.)
* Disease profile data model: This model is intended to represent the characteristics of the different diseases that can be worsened by the pollutants (asthma, cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, etc.)
* Vehicle profile data model: This data model is intended to represent the charaterictics of the diferent types of vehicles considered in the smart city scenario. This data model also represents the location of the vehicle. 

## Motivation

Nowadays, the high density of vehicles in current cities has led to several complex issues, such as traffic congestion, pollution, longer trip time, decreasing public safety and increasing noise. For instance, in Mexico City, with 20 million people, there are 4 million vehicles on the road and a total of 22 million trips every day
We proposed to develop a smart city app called "Green Route". The objective of Green Route is to help the final user to determine the best route to follow to reach a destination, taking into account the user profile (e.g. age, health conditions, disabilities, etc.), and the user preferences, such as transport type. Green Route proposes the ideal route for the user, avoiding routes with high levels of pollution, floods or pollen, etc., allowing for instance, to obtain the preferred routes for people with respiratory diseases. Green Route obtains data from mobile and fixed sensors (based on the IoT approach) to get real time information. Additionally, Green Route obtains data from other sources, such as air conditions provided as open data and data generated through the concept of human-as-a-sensor to get the user feedback about specific conditions in its location (e.g., rain, pollution, etc.).  

## State of the art 
In order to carry out the development of "Green Route", we explored the projects and applicatios related to pollution, smart routes and weather monitoring domains.
* Citi-Sense-Mob: is a system to support green growth and sustainable by providing citizens and authorities with information on transport, CO2 emissions and air quality.
* MyNeighborhood: is a place for neighbours to gather, get to know each other and enjoy the space they share.
* OpenAlerts: is an application that allows anyone to automate their home in a simple and quick manner.Â 
* One.Stop.Transport platform (OST): is a platform for open data aggregation, transformation and delivery, following modern Open Data principles, standards and directives
* Waze: is a mobile application for traffic in real time  based in user feedback
* State of the art of mobility monitoring units. 
* The open data and information of the Air Quality Monitoring of Mexico City.
* Cloudino: is a technological component that enable us to connect an arduino to cloud.
